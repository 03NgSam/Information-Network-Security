# Information-Network-Security

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains Python and C implementations of various classical encryption algorithms, commonly studied in Information and Network Security courses. These ciphers are fundamental in understanding the principles of cryptography and data security.

## ✨ Features
- 🔐 **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places.
- 🔐 **Monoalphabetic Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext maps to a different letter in the alphabet.
- 🔐 **Hill Cipher**: A polygraphic substitution cipher utilizing matrix multiplication for encryption.
- 🔐 **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 matrix derived from a keyword.
- 🔐 **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that shifts letters based on a repeating key.
- 🔐 **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric-key encryption algorithm widely used for securing digital data.
- 🔐 **Feistel Cipher**: A symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run any of these encryption programs, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/03NgSam/Information-Network-Security.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the desired cipher directory
```bash
   cd Information-Network-Security/<Cipher Directory>
```

### 3. Run the implementation
- **For Python scripts:**
  ```bash
  python <script_name>.py
  ```

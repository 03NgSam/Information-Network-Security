# 🔑 Cryptographic Implementations

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental cryptographic algorithms, including classical ciphers and modern key exchange methods. These algorithms are essential for understanding cryptographic principles and secure communication.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔐 **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places.
- 🔐 **Monoalphabetic Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext maps to a different letter in the alphabet.
- 🔐 **Hill Cipher**: A polygraphic substitution cipher utilizing matrix multiplication for encryption.
- 🔐 **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 matrix derived from a keyword.
- 🔐 **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that shifts letters based on a repeating key.
- 🔐 **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric-key encryption algorithm widely used for securing digital data.
- 🔐 **Feistel Cipher**: A symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers.
- 🔐 **RSA Encryption**: A public-key cryptosystem based on modular exponentiation and prime factorization.
- 🔐 **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: A cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
